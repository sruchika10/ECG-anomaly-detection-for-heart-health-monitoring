The project focuses on the implementation and investigation of different machine learning classifiers, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), on the PTB-XL dataset. The PTB-XL dataset is recognized as the largest cardiovascular disease (CVD) dataset. The objective of the study is to develop a model that can accurately detect anomalies in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.

ECG anomaly detection is crucial for early intervention and timely treatment, potentially saving lives. Machine learning models, including CNNs, LSTMs, and kernel methods, have shown promise in capturing features and patterns indicative of anomalies in ECG signals. By leveraging these models, healthcare professionals can more accurately and efficiently analyze ECG signals, leading to improved patient outcomes and scalability.

The study aims to evaluate the performance of different classifiers, with a focus on CNN architectures such as scaled-down and modified versions of ResNets and GoogLeNet. By testing these models on the PTB-XL dataset, valuable insights can be gained into their effectiveness in detecting cardiovascular anomalies. The dataset's large size and diversity make it an ideal choice for this investigation.

Automated ECG interpretation has the potential to reduce variability and errors in medical settings, benefiting emergency rooms, operation theaters, and Holter ECG monitoring. By developing a robust machine learning system, the project aims to facilitate quick and accurate decision-making for treatment, benefiting the entire medical community.

In summary, this project aims to implement and assess the performance of various classifiers, predominantly CNNs, on the PTB-XL dataset. The goal is to develop a reliable and efficient automated ECG interpretation system that can aid healthcare professionals in detecting cardiovascular anomalies and making informed treatment decisions.
